        After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960,
      Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence
       Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau,
       Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the
     Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career
       by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his
       choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working
        under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.
